# Model

The dimensionalizes model can be written as:

At the centerline of cylinde the model becomes the next equation. At r = 0, because BC and the term 1/r the model has one indetermination. Applyg L'HÃ´pital's rule we can arrive at:

The Initial and Bounday Conditions are given by the following equations:
